# NG+ Account Grinding Guide

## Skills

Your goal is to get the best gear and max thief + max warfarer and optionally level 3 sorcerer/mage (for levitate).
Equip both warfarer augments and the thief augments. Warrior also has an augment that boost carry strength I think.

Note that leveling warfarer levels the rest, so I would suggest leveling Thief to level 8 and then only warfarer which does the rest.
It can be argued that you want to achieve that with minimal level progression to get arrested quicker at the Batthal gate although leveling also gives you more stamina and strength, so it is unclear whether that is true.
In case you *do* want to do that you would try to get these things as fast as possible without leveling:

1. All tokens (which gives you a ring that boosts DCP progression)
2. The DCP blessing of the dragonforged (which is only attainable in NG+, so you would have to speedrun NG to get there).
3. Potentially the Medusa's Bow which would allow you to level Warfarer (and thereby Thief) faster.

## Gear that you want

- 4-5 Portcrystals (that is just enough for current meta).
- 15 WLCs (but during character grind *way* more - around 200-300 for gear improvement and daggers - see below)
- Around 20 Ferrystones (actually fewer, but gathering these will be the least of your problems)
- 5+ Wakestones for falling deep
- Courtly clothes (you will wear those)
- 2 Rings of profusion (you get those in the cage when leaving the sea temple guy)
- Good daggers (I bought the ones from dragonforged in post-game)
- Optionally helm and/or scarf (get the rest and then check your weight - you want to stay light)
- 30-40 Healing Roborant since you never know what happens (Mincemeat roborant is what I use)
- A full stack (99) of Harpsud Roborant since you constantly want to fill your stamina bar
- (for any levitation strat) A lightwheight staff
- (for unending arrow strat) A lightwheight bow
- 1 unending arrow to end your last setup game
- (for unending arrow strat) 6+ unending arrows (technically you need 4 + 1 to end the save right before the final dragon). Anything above is spare in case you missed. I use 8.
- (untested backup strat) the Sphinx phial to pick up Ambrosius in case the griffing spawns at the beach and prevents you from talking to him. Not worth going to the Sphinx for though.

## Details

### Portcrystals
If you go for the unending arrow strat you have to restart the game multiple times anyway and can skip visiting the Sphinx for Portcrystals. Just use the ones you get from Brant and buy one at the dragonforged every game.
In case you don't want unending arrows and want to get everything in a single game ride the Griffin outside Vernworth to its nest, grab the portcrystal, then stumble through the mist to the Sphinx. Bring her parent and your Main pawn. Do all quests and duplicte the Portcrystal.

### WLCs
The best way to farm WLCs is to get 2 Thiefs with Bump and Lift (my Main Pawn is a Thief) and a Mage with Celestial Paean. Use Thief as vocation and just use Carve on the back legs of dragons while using Feint. The mage will
constantly heal you and your pawns (in case they fall revive them quickly since *they* are the ones farming WLCs) and often keep your stamina bar maxed for minutes. Just slug the dragon till it dies and go to the next dragon. If they levitate you can still hit their tail. Does almost no damage but you are aiming for the steal chance anyway.
The ones in the post-game at the portals (lasers from the sky) yield more WLCs, but once they're gone you're done with no chance of respawns thanks to limited sleeping. So I suggest farming 100-200 in normal game or repeat post-game a lot.

### Roborants

I am not sure what is easier: Farming the plants and crafting, or buying and waiting for restock. In both cases you need to wait a week or longer for things to replenish. Harspud is best farmed in Nameless Village (field at the beginning and then wait outside the Inn).

### Gold

Gold is less of a hassle than you might anticipate. The only gold I lacked and actually had to go farm is 40k. And that is just one visit to the cave outside Batthal that the dull blade quest sends you to early. Don't do that quest, just google a guide for the cave where you find the glimmercoal cave. In case you need more gold just wait for the ores to replenish there and repeat. Or look for some weird apple ripening arbitrage scheme on YouTube. There are way to many guides for that there.

### Gear Improvement

You want the final buff from the Dragonforged on all your clothing and weapons - simply because it drastically reduces their weight. That also means that you need level 3 improvement in any of the forge schools before that which *will be the most grind*. Especially if you
buff using Dwarven Smithing like me (help the Dwarf that gives you Mystic Archer vocation to get that, *don't do the dull blade questline as it is long and super annoying*).
Start those enhancements as early as possible since you need annoyingly rare materials for those. Note also that (except for those red dogs) most materials are easier to farm in normal game as Gorechimeras and Griffins have more and more regular spawns. For Gorechimera go to the waterfall cave after visiting Batthal.

### Setup for Runs

End your last game using any vocation that can shoot an unending arrow. Probably warfarer.
Do a save before going into the final tower. This save allows you to fix things without starting a new game. Make sure that your storage is empty and you have everything you need in your inventory.
Do another save right before entering the area of the final dragon. Empty the pockets of all your pawns. If they want to pick it up again throw them off the cliff after emptying.
In a NG+ game your storage will have all items you and your pawns had in your inventories. So this makes sure that you don't have to sieve through trash when re-equipping in a speedrun.
That save is the one you have to restore using a Savegame Manager everytime you want to start a new run. Every time you load that save enter the area, rush out to skip the fight, then kill the dragon using an unending arrow. Walk out of the celebration scene to the door to end it a bit earlier, then start a NG+ game.

Good luck.
